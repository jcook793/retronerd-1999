John's Wants - Last updated 2/20/99

This isn't complete, I'm interested in most stuff that I don't have!
This is just a list of stuff that, to me, is the stuff that I have
least of and need the most.

If you have something on here that you want to get rid of, let me
know!  We can work out a trade or a cash deal.  Feel free to contact
me at jcook@earthling.net (that's earthlinG, not earthlinK).
